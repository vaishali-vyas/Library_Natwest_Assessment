What is in this package/library and whatâ€™s it used for- this is Library project with domain books. this is done using springboot and HTML. this technically should be able to provide list of books with category, author and returnpolicy. text file has been used to copy mysql codes. there are 3.html file ; index html page, books html and sign up html. homepage.js and books.html are linked.

the final output should be able to add, edit, update and delete name of the author.

Status of the project - backend has been built using springboot, frontend using Html. test scripts written are work in progress and are commented out as they are not part of requirement. Postman being used to test. Get to the localhost:8080 was successfully tested.

Why are we doing this? - this is to understrand the knowleage completion and gap in order to close the gap and have e2e understanding 

How I expected the challenge to go. - 
What went well? - building backend on springboot, using mysql database went well. 
What didn't go as planned? I was thinking to build end to end application with completed testing however could not finish test scripts due to time constraint. JS CRUD function - could not deploy fully as needed more understanding 
Possible improvements for future revisions of the project. 
- could use further bootstrap funtionality to make the webpage more interactive, if time allowed
- main page, books listing by category page and user to be able to view if the books available
