# Library_Natwest_Assessment

What is in this package/library and whatâ€™s it used for- this is Library project with domain books. this is done using springboot and HTML. this technically should be able to provide list of books with category, author and returnpolicy. text file has been used to copy mysql codes.

Status of the project - backend has been built using springboot, frontend using Html. test scripts written are work in progress and are commented out as they are not part of requirement. Postman being used to test. Get to the localhost:8080 was successfully tested.

Why are we doing this? - this is to understrand the knowleage completion and gap in order to close the gap and have e2e understanding 

How I expected the challenge to go. - 
What went well? - building backend on springboot, using mysql database went well. 
What didn't go as planned? building frontend and linking that with backend dint go well as I would have thought
Possible improvements for future revisions of the project. -
